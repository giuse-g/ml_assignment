\section*{Appendix}
In this appendix, you are allowed to write down the parameters you optimized and specify what grid you used to search the space of hyperparameter values. You are free to be a little creative with how you do this. For example, if you deepened your grid search along the way, then you may want to specify several grids in different columns. You may also have used a hyperparameter tuning method that does not require a typical grid at all but instead requires some additional parameters to set up the hyperparameter tuning. You could also put that in the appendix. In any case: please only use the appendix to tabulate parameters, not to enter more descriptions or explanations of the method. Your methods should be a part of the Report section.
