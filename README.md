# Assignment

This is a template repository for the assignment of the courses FEM31002 Machine Learning and FEM21045 Machine Learning in Finance. You will use GitHub to work on the assignment with your group, and we provide this template repository as a starting point for your group repository.

If you want to learn about Git, GitHub and its workflow, please check out the GitHub practice [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/111864603-machinelearning2022)!


## Files in this template repository

Relevant instructions for the assignment are provided in the following files:

- [instructions_assignment.pdf](/instructions_assignment.pdf): Assignment instructions and description.
- [instructions_codegrade.pdf](/instructions_codegrade.pdf): Instructions on how to link your GitHub repository to CodeGrade.

The following files contain templates that you should use. Update these files by pushing changes from your local repository. **Do not delete, rename, or move these files**. Otherwise we may not be able to grade your submission.

- [predictions.txt](/predictions.txt): Put your predictions for the test data into this file as a single bitstring of ones and zeros.
- [report.tex](/report.tex): Use this file to write your report. Do not change the layout in any way (such as making the font size or the margins smaller).
- [report.pdf](/report.pdf): The compiled pdf of your report, generated by the source file above.
- [questions.tex](/questions.tex): Use this file to prepare your answers to the question part of the assignment. Do not change the layout in any way (such as making the font size or the margins smaller).
- [questions.pdf](/questions.pdf): The compiled pdf of your answers, generated by the source file above.

The `data` folder contains the following files for the data that you will use in the assignment. **Do not modify the files containing the raw data.** If you perform further data pre-processing, always store the processed data in a different file.

- [train.csv](/data/train.csv): Use this part of the data for training your prediction algorithm.
- [test.csv](/data/test.csv): The test data for which you should make predictions.
- [codebook.csv](/data/codebook.csv): Detailed descriptions of the variables.

In addition, you may find the following files useful:

- [README.md](/README.md): Information on this template repository.
- [Introduction_to_GitHub.pdf](/Introduction_to_GitHub.pdf): Slides from our introduction video to Git and GitHub.
- [Git-cheat-sheet.pdf](Git-cheat-sheet.pdf): A cheat sheet containing useful Git commands.

In addition to the files you already find here, add the files for your code to your repository. Your code will not be graded, but make sure that your submitted predictions can be replicated with the submitted code. We may ask you to do so in our presence. You can also put any other files that you find useful to complete the assignment into your repository.


> **Good luck with the assignment!**
